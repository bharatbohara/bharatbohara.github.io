            <h3>Revolutionizing Circuit Design with Deep Learning</h3>
            <p>The world of analog circuit design is complex, often requiring significant manual effort to identify components and simulate circuits accurately. My latest research, funded by the National Science Foundation, tackles this challenge head-on by introducing a deep learning-based framework that automates the identification and simulation of hand-drawn schematics. The framework leverages state-of-the-art computer vision models to achieve a remarkable mean average precision (mAP) of 96.7% in component detection and a NetList generation accuracy of 95.71%.</p>
            <p>The most exciting part? The framework not only identifies components but also generates a graphical representation of circuit topologies, paving the way for more intuitive design processes.</p>

            <h3>Ensuring Microgrid Reliability with Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Microgrids are the backbone of modern energy systems, but their reliability can be compromised by faults in power converters at various nodes. In a project funded by the National Science Foundation, I developed a machine learning approach to monitor the health of microgrids in real-time. This approach not only identifies fault-prone zones but also pinpoints their exact location within the grid.</p>
            <p>By analyzing interactions between power converters, this system ensures that microgrids remain resilient, reducing downtime and enhancing overall efficiency.</p>

            <h3>AI-Powered Energy Management: A Step Towards Smarter Microgrids</h3>
            <p>In collaboration with Team AiGrid, I had the opportunity to develop an AI-powered energy management tool that made it to the finals of the UH Energy Innovation Commercialization Competition. This tool is designed to learn and adapt to real-time data, predicting future energy demands and optimizing management strategies for microgrid operators.</p>
            <p>Our AI tool not only forecasts energy needs but also identifies the most cost-effective and resilient scenarios, ensuring that microgrids remain efficient and reliable even under fluctuating conditions.</p>

            <h3>Predictive Control for Energy Savings in Net-Zero Buildings</h3>
            <p>As part of my Masterâ€™s thesis, I designed an optimal predictive control system aimed at maximizing energy savings in buildings while maintaining thermal comfort. This system was implemented in Team Shunya House, a net-zero energy building created for the US-DOE Solar-Decathlon challenge.</p>
            <p>The adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) system achieved impressive energy savings of 7.06%, demonstrating the potential of predictive control in real-world applications.</p>

            <h3>Enhancing Load Forecasting with Advanced LSTM Models</h3>
            <p>Accurate load forecasting is crucial for maintaining grid stability, especially in smart grids. In a course project on Smart Grids, I developed bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and CNN-BiLSTM models to forecast 24-hour ahead load profiles. These models significantly reduced RMSE errors compared to standard LSTM models, with BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM achieving error reductions of 5.6% and 2.85%, respectively.</p>
            <p>These advancements in load forecasting techniques are key to enabling more efficient and responsive energy management systems.</p>

            <h3>EnerCoin: The Future of Energy Trading in Smart Grids</h3>
            <p>The concept of trading renewable energy in smart grids has gained traction with the development of EnerCoin, a decentralized digital currency built on the Ethereum platform. In a poster presentation project, I developed a dynamic pricing algorithm that allows consumers and prosumers to participate competitively in the energy market.</p>
            <p>EnerCoin represents a step towards democratizing energy trading, making renewable energy accessible and affordable for everyone.</p>
